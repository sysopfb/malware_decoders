        ChaCha is an improved variant of Salsa20.
        
        Salsa20 was submitted to eSTREAM, an EU stream cipher
        competition.  Salsa20 was originally defined to be 20
        rounds.  Reduced round versions, Salsa20/8 (8 rounds) and
        Salsa20/12 (12 rounds), were later submitted.  Salsa20/12
        was chosen as one of the winners and 12 rounds was deemed
        the "right blend" of security and efficiency.  Salsa20 
        is about 3x-4x faster than AES-128.
        
        Both ChaCha and Salsa20 accept a 128-bit or a 256-bit key 
        and a 64-bit IV to set up an initial 64-byte state.  For 
        each 64-bytes of data, the state gets scrambled and XORed 
        with the previous state.  This new state is then XORed 
        with the input data to produce the output.  Both being 
        stream ciphers, their encryption and decryption functions 
        are identical.  
        
        While Salsa20's diffusion properties are very good, some 
        claimed the IV/keystream correlation was too strong for 
        comfort.  To satisfy, another variant called XSalsa20 
        implements a 128-bit IV.  For the record, EU eSTREAM team 
        did select Salsa20/12 as a solid cipher providing 128-bit 
        security.  
        
        ChaCha is a minor tweak of Salsa20 that significantly 
        improves its diffusion per round.  ChaCha is more secure 
        than Salsa20 and 8 rounds of ChaCha, aka ChaCha8, provides 
        128-bit security.  (FWIW, I have not seen any calls for a 
        128-bit IV version of ChaCha or XChaCha.)  
        
        Another benefit is that ChaCha8 is about 5-8% faster than 
        Salsa20/8 on most 32- and 64-bit PPC and Intel processors.  
        SIMD machines should see even more improvement.  
        
        Sample usage:
          from chacha import ChaCha
          
          cc8 = ChaCha(key, iv)
          ciphertext = cc8.encrypt(plaintext)
          
          cc8 = ChaCha(key, iv)
          plaintext = cc8.decrypt(ciphertext)
        
        Remember, the purpose of this program is educational; it 
        is NOT a secure implementation nor is a pure Python version 
        going to be fast.  Encrypting large data will be less than 
        satisfying.  Also, no effort is made to protect the key or 
        wipe critical memory after use.  
        
        Note that psyco, a specializing compiler somewhat akin to 
        a JIT, can provide a 2x+ performance improvement over 
        vanilla Python 32-bit architectures.  A 64-bit version of 
        psyco does not exist.  See http://psyco.sourceforge.net

        algorithm, please see http://cr.yp.to/chacha.html
        
        All we need now is a keystream AND authentication in the 
        same pass.
